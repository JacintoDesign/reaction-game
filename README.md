## üéØ Overview

This reaction timer game challenges users to click as quickly as possible when a 3D shape changes from orange to green. It features a complex dodecahedron with nested geometric shapes, particle effects, and professional UI design.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Accurate Timing**: Millisecond-precise reaction time measurement
- **Random Delays**: 1-5 second random intervals to prevent pattern recognition
- **False Start Detection**: Prevents cheating with early clicks
- **Performance Rating System**: Categorizes reactions from "Amazing" (<200ms) to "Below Average" (>400ms)

### Visual Excellence
- **3D Graphics**: Complex dodecahedron with nested icosahedron and tetrahedron
- **Dynamic Animations**: Shape rotation, scaling, and breathing effects
- **Particle Systems**: Background particles and burst effects on ready state
- **Responsive Lighting**: Ambient, directional, and dynamic point lighting
- **Visual State Feedback**: Color-coded game states with smooth transitions

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Controls**: Click or spacebar to interact
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Tracks attempts, best time, and average performance
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Tutorial**: Built-in instructions overlay
- **Professional Design**: Modern dark theme with gradient accents

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start**: Click the game area or press spacebar to begin
2. **Wait**: The shape will turn orange - don't click yet!
3. **React**: When the shape turns green, click as fast as possible
4. **Improve**: Track your stats and try to beat your best time

### Performance Guide
- ‚ö° **Amazing**: < 200ms
- üéØ **Very Good**: 200-250ms
- ‚úÖ **Good**: 250-300ms
- üëç **Average**: 300-400ms
- üêå **Below Average**: > 400ms

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Three.js r128**: 3D graphics and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic and state management
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and backdrop filters
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and canvas integration

### Key Components

#### Game State Management
```javascript
const GameState = {
    IDLE: 'idle',
    WAITING: 'waiting',
    READY: 'ready',
    COMPLETE: 'complete',
    FALSE_START: 'falseStart'
};
```

#### 3D Scene Setup
- **Dodecahedron**: Main 12-sided geometric shape
- **Nested Shapes**: Inner icosahedron and tetrahedron
- **Lighting System**: Ambient, directional, and dynamic point lights
- **Particle Effects**: Background particles and reactive burst animations

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient animation loops with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Proper memory management for 3D objects
- Responsive design with device pixel ratio handling
- Optimized particle systems with lifecycle management
